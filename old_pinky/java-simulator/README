Okay folks, here it is...  A half completed assembler. :)  The only
reason why I am releasing it in its current state is because I am
pretty busy right now and wont have much time to play with it.  I
figure that it would probably be useful to someone somewhere, so
here it is.. enjoy..

The web page is http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~mcumings/pinky/

My Name:  Mike Cumings

I'll be a bit more formal in a rewrite of this file later on, but
for now just type 'make', then 'java PinkyAssembler myasm.asm'.
This will create the binary 'myasm.asm.bin'.  I know, I know..
The name is annoying as can be, but like I said I am just trying
to dump this on the public right now, not sell it. :)
